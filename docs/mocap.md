# Motion Capture System


The motion capture setup consists of the following components:

- **Optitrack cameras**: The system is used to track the position and orientation of the robot in real-time. The system consists of multiple cameras that track the position of reflective markers on the robot. The data is then sent to a computer running the OptiTrack software, which processes the data and sends it to the robot.
- **OptiHub**: Hub connecting it all.
